This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

In this tutorial series we will be building an e-commerence app to showcase the features of NextJS.

Each tutorial will **have a branch** associated with it, i.e. the first tutorial will be on the brach `tutorial_1` and so forth.

There will be a **Pull Request** between the branches of each tutorial, so that it's very easy for you to see what has been added/changed in each lesson.

Happy coding!
